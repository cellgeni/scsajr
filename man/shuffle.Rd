\title{Shuffle DNA sequences by k‐mer permutation}
\usage{
shuffle(seqs, k = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqs}{A character vector of DNA sequences (each element may include ambiguous bases).}

\item{k}{Integer; length of k‐mers to preserve in the shuffle. Default is 1 (mononucleotide shuffle).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{universalmotif::shuffle_sequences()}, such as \code{seed}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as \code{seqs}, where each element is a shuffled
sequence preserving k‐mer composition.
If \code{seqs[i]} contains ambiguous bases, they are shuffled along with the sequence.
}
\description{
Given a character vector of DNA sequences, this function generates shuffled versions
of each sequence that preserve k‐mer composition, using a user‐specified k value.
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item Converts each input sequence to uppercase.
\item Uses \code{Biostrings::BStringSet()} to construct a set of DNA strings.
\item Calls \code{universalmotif::shuffle_sequences()} on the \code{BStringSet}, specifying \code{k}.
\item Converts the shuffled \code{BStringSet} back to a character vector.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
original_seqs <- c("ATGCCGTA", "NNAGTCA", "ccggttaa")
shuffled <- shuffle_sequences(original_seqs, k = 2, seed = 42)
print(shuffled)
}
