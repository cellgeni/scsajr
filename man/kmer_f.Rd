\title{Compute k-mer frequencies from a set of sequences}
\usage{
kmer_f(seqs, k = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqs}{Character vector of nucleotide sequences (may include \code{NA}), all in uppercase.}

\item{k}{Integer; length of k-mers to tally. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of k-mer counts, where names are k-mer strings and values
are their frequencies across all input sequences.
}
\description{
Counts occurrences of all k-mers of length \code{k} across a vector of DNA sequences.
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item Removes \code{NA} entries from \code{seqs}.
\item For each sequence, extracts all substrings of length \code{k} starting at positions
\code{1:(nchar(seq) - k + 1)}.
\item Aggregates counts of each k-mer across all sequences and returns a named vector.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
seqs <- c("ATGCA", "TGCAT", NA, "ATGCA")
kmer_counts <- kmer_f(seqs, k = 3)
# Might return counts for "ATG", "TGC", "GCA", "CAT", etc.
}
